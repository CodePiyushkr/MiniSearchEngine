Cloud and DevOps

Instead of buying servers, you rent them from AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. Pay for what you use. Scale up when traffic spikes, scale down when it's quiet.

AWS has the most services and biggest market share. Azure is popular if you're already in the Microsoft ecosystem. Google Cloud has great machine learning tools.

DevOps is basically breaking down the wall between developers and operations. Write code, test it automatically, deploy it automatically. No more "works on my machine" excuses.

Docker containers are a game changer. Package your app with all its dependencies. Runs the same everywhere - your laptop, test server, production.

Kubernetes manages containers at scale. Steep learning curve but worth it for big deployments. Overkill for small projects though.

CI/CD pipelines - code goes from your commit to production automatically. GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins. Set it up once and forget about manual deployments.
