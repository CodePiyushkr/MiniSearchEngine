Machine Learning Stuff

So I've been messing around with machine learning lately. Basically you feed a computer a bunch of data and it figures out patterns on its own. Pretty wild when you think about it.

There's supervised learning where you label everything like "this is a cat, this is a dog" and the model learns from that. Unsupervised is when you just throw data at it and let it find patterns. Reinforcement learning is like training a dog with treats - reward good behavior.

Deep learning is the fancy stuff with neural networks. TensorFlow and PyTorch are what most people use. PyTorch feels more pythonic to me but TensorFlow has better production tools.

The hardest part honestly isn't the algorithms - it's getting clean data. Garbage in, garbage out. You'll spend 80% of your time just cleaning and preparing data.

Netflix recommendations, spam filters, self-driving cars - all machine learning under the hood.
