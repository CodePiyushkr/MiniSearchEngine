Web Dev Notes

Frontend is what users see - HTML for structure, CSS for styling, JavaScript for interactivity. React is everywhere right now. Vue is nice too, easier to learn imo. Angular is more enterprise-y.

Backend is the server stuff. I use Node.js mostly because I already know JavaScript. Python with Django or Flask is solid too. Ruby on Rails people swear by it but seems less popular now.

Databases - PostgreSQL for relational stuff, MongoDB if you want NoSQL. Just pick one and learn it well.

APIs connect everything. REST is the standard, GraphQL is newer and lets frontend devs ask for exactly what they need.

Mobile responsive design isn't optional anymore. Half your users are on phones.

New frameworks pop up every week. Don't chase every shiny thing. Master the fundamentals first - they don't change much.
